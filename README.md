# This application is supposed to change your PNG into a coloring page 

it works better with certain pictures, usually when the picture is not dark and has clear outlines it performes best 

program takes 3 arguments  
#
1 - path to your picture (eg. path/picture.png)

#
2 - numerical value that determines to how many colors picture is reduced before changing it to black and white 

works best in 3-10 range where higher values add detail but may appear grainy	
#
3 - the sensitivity of black to light 

recommended: 30â€“100, where higher values add more black, and lower values make the image lighter

#
take notice that this program is by no means perfect and tweak 2nd and 3rd argument to get the best result
